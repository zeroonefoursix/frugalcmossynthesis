# A note on power

These designs work best with 9V, however if using a battery you will notice that when utilising a single 40106 for multiple modules that they will cross-modulate/cross-talk without being connected, this is due to the 9V battery not being able to supply sufficient current to the 40106. A bench power supply with at least 200ma will go a long way to solving any cross-modulation/talk
