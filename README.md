# Hand Turned Synthesis: A One Chip Exploration of CMOS Electronics
The Respository is a collection of circuits build around the CD40106BE IC, which is used for audio synthesis. The folders above contain the toolkit and the KiCad files for the Monophonic Subtractive Synth. **Below the abstract are creative outputs of the toolkit in the authors' projects.**

**Abstract:**

We discuss and give a concise overview of the historical
practices and approaches to utilising budget-friendly electronic
components as a foundation for constructing simple sound
making circuits. Building on the work of Lunetta, Collins and
Wilson we focus specifically on the use of a 40106 CMOS
integrated circuit (IC). Our research goal is to provide a tool kit
of circuits for common synthesis elements based around the use
of a single 40106 IC that may be of use to those involved in
sound installations and frugal instrument design as well as
practitioners working within accessibility and
workshop/pedagogical scenarios. The authors demonstrate the
application of the tool kit in their own projects, such as a
monophonic synthesizer as well as several hand cranked
sculptures that are powered and ‘played’ by the interaction
between the user and the hand crank. Overall, we gather a broad
range of relevant information that is difficult to find in one place
and provide a practical tool kit that is pitched at an introductory
level and describe how this is incorporated into the design of
interactive electronic instruments. We also attempt to highlight
fundamental electronics and synthesis principles while
embracing terminology common to both electronics and
synthesizer communities.
