# Monophonic Subtractive Synthesizer
The monophonic subtractive synth usees the six building blocks of the toolkit consisting of a VCO, two LFO’s, a VCF, a VCA and an ENV building block, but patched in a creative way. Each ‘module’ is able to patched to one another with a 3.5mm connector or used without, in which a preset patch is normalled. The layout is such due to the constraints of designing for a single sided PCB board, which was hand etched, drilled and populated by the authors. It is noted that a revised layout would be less idiosyncratic and follow more standard synthesizer layout conventions.
